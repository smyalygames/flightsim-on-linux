# NewSky
[Newsky](https://newsky.app/) is a client for virtual airlines to book, track, and manage flights.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
Whilst Newsky can work on Linux, their [official stance]
(https://wiki.newsky.app/#is-maclinux-supported) is that it is unsupported. It is "planned", so hopefully
they do not intentionally break anything, there is no guarantee, and do not expect support from Newsky on
running with Linux.

## Installation

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
**Difficulty:** easy-medium
</Callout>

Newsky can have issues launching alongside MSFS when running using protontricks, to get around this,
Newsky can be launched using Wine, and then use a networked SimConnect session to connect to MSFS.

<steps>

### Download and run the Newsky installer

You can download the Newsky installer from the link on [their website](https://newsky.app/).

Open Winetricks (not Protontricks), select the default prefix which should show up in the window 
titlebar under /home/USER/.wine. Then select to run an arbitrary executable, find the Newsky installer
you downloaded, and run the installer. Once Newsky has finished installing, it should have added a shortcut
in your application launcher, and opens automatically.

Sign into Newsky, then click on your user profile in the top right, and open settings. Scroll down until 
you reach the "Networked setup" setup.

Enable the Networked setup, and select MSFS as the simulator, 127.0.0.1 as the IP address, and a free port.
I chose 8381, other ports may/may not work for you, but this worked for me.

### Enable Networked SimConnect for MSFS

Navigate to `PATH/TO/COMPDATA/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft\ Flight\Simulator`

Open SimConnect.xml in a text editor of your choice

Create a new SimConnect.comm section, where PORT is the port that was set in Newsky:

`<SimConnect.Comm>
        <Descr>Static IP4 port</Descr>
        <Protocol>IPv4</Protocol>
        <Address>127.0.0.1</Address>
        <Scope>global</Scope>
        <Port>8381</Port>
        <MaxClients>64</MaxClients>
        <MaxRecvSize>41088</MaxRecvSize>
    </SimConnect.Comm>`

Now launch MSFS, and Newsky should be able to connect to the simulator. The text in the top left saying
"waiting for sim connection" should change to "connected to simulator", and will show during towards the end
of the loading screen, or on the main menu. If it does not change, check that the ports match, or try another
port.

There should be no need to create a desktop icon yourself, as Winetricks should have created it for you.
