# Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020

This is currently the latest release of Flight Simulator from Microsoft, which has been made for Windows only.

## Running Flight Simulator

Flight Simulator has been able to run with Proton (it works for me on Proton 8.0), which means the only way
to run this game would be to buy it on
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1250410/Microsoft_Flight_Simulator_40th_Anniversary_Edition/) as the
Microsoft Store does not work on Linux.

<Callout type="error" emoji="⚠️">
  Do **NOT** change Proton versions or Verify Game Integrity once you have
  downloaded the entire game from the simulator without following the
  [guide](#updating-proton) below as this can cause you to lose everything you
  have downloaded/installed for the simulator!
</Callout>

### Configuring

Some tinkering may also be required to run this game. You can find other people's fixes on
[ProtonDB](https://www.protondb.com/app/1250410) if you run into problems launching the game.

[Launch options](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/7D01-D2DD-D75E-2955) may be needed for this game to start.
This one below is what works for me:

```
-FastLaunch
```

Even if this launch option is not required, this would be useful as it skips the intro video at the beginning.

## Installing Addons

Most of the time, installing addons should be pretty straight forward, unless there is an installer involved.

The addons bought from the store in-game should be able to be installed easily and work out of the box.

### Drag and Drop Installations

Some addons, most commonly freeware where you download it outside of Flight Simulator, are a simple drag and drop
into the `Community` Folder, which is stored in `compdata` (folder to store Wine/Proton configs/data for each game) >
`1250410` (Flight Simulator's game ID on Steam).

For example, this is the directory to the `Community` Folder if Flight Simulator is installed in the default location:

```
~/.steam/steam/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft Flight Simulator/Packages/Community/
```

The equivalent version of this on Windows is:

```
C:\users\steamuser\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft Flight Simulator\Packages\Community\
```

### Executable Installers

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Dealing with developer's installers is usually requires more tinkering and
  therefore you may need more advanced knowledge on Windows and Linux (alongside
  the Desktop Environment you're using)!
</Callout>

If you buy addons directly from a developer, it will be likely that you will be given an installer that is an
executable. These installers cannot be directly run with Wine as this will not use with Wine prefix for Flight
Simulator.

The easiest way to deal with these installer is to use Protontricks, where you can follow the guide
[here](msfs/protontricks) on how to use it.

## Updating Proton

<Steps>

### Deactivating Addons

First, make sure to deactivate all of your addons that you have installed if these need to be done manually before
being uninstalled.

Once this is done, up the uninstaller to uninstall all your addons, as you will need to reinstall them after Proton has
been updated. This can be done by running this command in the terminal:

```shell copy
protontricks -c "wine uninstaller" 1250410
```

### Backup Flight Simulator compdata

Find the `compdata` folder for Flight Simulator (`1250410`) and rename and add `bak` to the folder name, this will look
like `1250410.bak`. The `compdata` folder can be found by right-clicking Flight Simulator on Steam -> Manage -> Browse
local files, then go up two directories, and you should see `compdata` there.

### Update Proton Version

In Steam, right-click on Flight Simulator -> Properties -> Compatability, then change the version of Proton to your own
choice.

Run the game, and you can just close the game once you see the login screen.

### Move old files to new version

In your compdata folder, move the folder for Flight Simulator in AppData the backup you made earlier, to the new folder
that was created.

This can be done with one command (edit the directory to your `compdata` if it's not the same)

```shell copy
mv ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/1250410.bak/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft\ Flight\ Simulator/ ~/.steam/root/steamapps/compatdata/1250410/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft\ Flight\ Simulator/
```

You should now be able to run Flight Simulator without needing to download the entire game again. You will have to
install all of your addons that you uninstalled earlier again though.
