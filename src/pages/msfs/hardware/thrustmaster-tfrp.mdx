# Thrustmaster Flight Rudder Pedals

[Thrustmaster Flight Rudder Pedals](https://www.thrustmaster.com/fr-fr/products/t-flight-rudder-pedals) is a popular hardware pedals unit for many flight simulators.
It works great with a Honeycomb Alpha Bravo combo for much cheaper than the Honeycomb charlie gear.

To make it recognizable by Linux one tweak is needed.

## Setup

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  **Difficulty:** Medium
</Callout>

<Steps>

### Create a udev rule

Create a /etc/udev/rules.d/60-thrustmaster.rules and add the following:

```
KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="044f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="b679", MODE="0660", TAG+="uaccess"
```
Those instructions work on Ubuntu 22.04. 

</Steps>

You should now see your TFRP in the controller settings in MSFS and can map it to your liking.

## Warning & utility

Some Proton versions make the TFRP behave erraticaly within MSFS. GE-Proton9-25 work for me but not GE-Proton9-26 nor GE-Proton9-27.
To check your gear outside the proton layer, I found the evjstest from [evjs](https://github.com/shumatech/evjs) utility to work perfectly.
