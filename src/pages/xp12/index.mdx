# X-Plane 12

X-Plane 12 is the current generation simulator from Laminar Research. This simulator will run on Linux, as well as Mac
and Windows.

## Running X-Plane 12

This simulator should be able to run out of the box with minimal problems. There are two options when buying this simulator:

- [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2014780/XPlane_12/)
- [Official Website](https://www.x-plane.com/desktop/buy-it/)

## Installing Addons

Installing a lot of addons for X-Plane is quite simple as this game runs natively on Linux. A lot of the installation
is the same as Windows.

### Installing Windows only Addons

Previously on X-Plane 11, you could run the simulator through Wine/Proton which removed Vulkan support and forced the game
to run in OpenGL. X-Plane 12 drops OpenGL and forces Vulkan, leading to an error when you try to start the simulator.
