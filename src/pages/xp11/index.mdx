## Installing Addons

Installing a lot of addons for X-Plane is quite simple as this game runs natively on Linux. A lot of the installation
is the same as Windows.

### Installing Windows only Addons

The only way to install addons that will only work on the Windows version of X-Plane, you will need to run X-Plane
through Proton.

  Using Proton will remove Vulkan support, running the game in OpenGL, which
  will lead to a performance loss and therefore is not recommended!
</Callout>

Most of these addons can be installed as usual with just a simple drag and drop into the X-Plane folder. However, some
developers use their own executable installers, like addons bought from X-Aviation.

These can be installed using Wine, where you will have to select the path to your X-Plane folder.
