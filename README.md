A website to provide information on how to get flight simulators and their addons working on Linux.

A lot of games designed on Windows work well on Linux through Proton, however, there is not a lot of
documentation when it comes to installing addons, especially with flight simulators as a lot of them
contain DRM that is designed for Windows only and hopefully these guides can be useful for getting these
addons set up on Linux.

## Usage

This website is created using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) to provide
the documentation framework.

### Development

To run a development server, run:

```shell
pnpm run dev
```

## Contributing

Or if you want to provide any feedback, feel free to submit an Issue.

## Authors

This project has been developed by [Anthony Berg](https://github.com/smyalygames) to hopefully allow
people trying out or using Linux to enjoy flight simulators without the need of using Windows.
